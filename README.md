# Shapley Value Computation for Concept-based Model Explanation

This project computes Shapley values to explain the predictions of a deep learning model (Inception-v3) based on concept-based features (subject and background concepts). The Shapley values are used to evaluate the importance of each concept in influencing the model's decision for a given target class.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- tqdm
- numpy
- json

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
